## The facts

Recently there has been a massive annoucement involving moderation in Minecraft (Bedrock), and it is sure to make it's way over to Minecraft Java Edition with the [move from a Mojang account to a Microsoft account](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house).

The annoucement was posted on [the minecraft website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/moderating-minecraft) 4 days ago, on November 20th, 2020.

The change allows "Minecraft moderators" to globally ban players from "[Realms] and Featured Servers." The state of external servers is not mentioned. External servers can only be accessed from the Windows 10 and Mobile versions of Minecraft (Bedrock.)

As of November 24th, 2020, Featured Servers include

* CubeCraft
* Mineplex
* Galaxite
* Lifeboat
* Mineville
* The Hive

Additonally, 4 of the 6 Featured Servers are also available on Minecraft Java Edition.

* CubeCraft `play.cubecraft.net`
* Mineplex `us.mineplex.com`
* Mineville `play.mineville.org`
* The Hive `play.hivemc.com`

The majority of these servers proudly advertise the fact that they are "Offical Minecraft Partners."

These are heavily moderated servers that have seperate server networks for each edition of Minecraft they support.

(I have a suspicion that CubeCraft Games is using a fork of Geyser (A Minecraft Java Edition plugin allowing players from Minercraft (Bedrock) to connect.), since the server exibits some signs of the Movement and Skin errors in the current build of Geyser, as well as sharing the same Minigames. Nevertheless, there is no crossplay.)

The wording of the article implies that a ban from a single one of the servers will either flag the user for further investigation or immedately ban the user from all online services, including Realms and possibly external servers. Either way, this puts the user at the mercy of any possibly questionable moderation practices and questonable anti-cheats (Many anti-cheats will ban the user on the first strike, however these bans will almost always have an appeal process.)

Offically, the reasons for a ban include

* hate speech
* sexual content and grooming
* real life threats
* exposing the personal information of others
* posting links to malicious software
* impersonating staff
* cheating/expoits
* general commerical spamming

The page does not mention how severe a rule-breakage must be to consitute a ban or flagging.

According to [this](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360052618531) page, **the bans are non-appealable.** If a ban is unjustified, what does this mean? We are yet to know...

## The speculation

Warning: Opinions incoming!

### This is the change that could irreversably break multiplayer Minecraft, and I am quite certain it may, under one conditon.

I was first informed of this from a xisumavoid video posted on xisumatwo.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56gn_kPk0sw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

While the video was missing detail on what Featured Servers are as well as a few other things, I share opinions with what was stated in the video.

Assuming that changes will only apply to Realms, Featured Servers, and Normal XBL multiplayer in Minecraft (Bedrock), I doubt it will have a big issue in the context of Minecraft (Bedrock) alone, since Online Play can already be restricted via other Microsoft shenanigans.

As for Minecraft Java Edition, the "core" userbase, nothing is said for certain. Based off of what little information we have, I would assume that the Global bans would only apply to Realms and Offical Minecraft Partner run (Featured) servers. LAN play and other servers are likely to be uneffected.

(If they were, I am sure that the communities surronding said other servers would collapse in an instant. Hey! There is that one condition!)

I would assume that moderators on Featured Servers would now have the ability to flag players for banning via a command or a moderation panel.

I would also assume that the partner program would expand with this change.

#### With that, I have said everything I wanted to say. Toodles, and good luck!
