## Removal of the Funkin' rehost

Due to legal reasons, namely [the changing of the license to one missing critical legal information](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin/commit/8bd9126acd48a0c23124b897561b5fca1e161a8c), this website would have operated in a legal grey area I'm not confortable in. 

TL;DR: ðŸ–• ninjamuffin99, change your license back to one that makes legal sense, and keeping a project open source should take priority over porting to platforms like Nintendo Switch or iOS.
