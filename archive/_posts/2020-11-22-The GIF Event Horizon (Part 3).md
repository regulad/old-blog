When does a GIF go from being funny to being cringe? I believe that there are 3 categories of GIFs.

A safe distance away | Close to the event horizon | Inside the singularity
--- | --- | ---
This category is for gifs that are legitimately funny and may cause a chuckle. | These are the gifs that your parents & teachers use trying to be relatable. | Aunt Sally learned how to use GIFHY, and she like minions! Take cover!

Going further right the GIFs will become cringer and lose all their comedic value. Any message they may be attempting to convey is completely lost. Lets go through them one by one, shall we?

Today lets cover the third category,

### Inside the singularity

These GIFs are enjoyed by nobody who has seen the other categories. They are so uncommon that it took a bit of time to search for them.

These GIFs are flooded with tags in an attempt to increase searchability. They:

* are not funny
* are not cute
* are only shared by people that are horrible out of touch

In fact, I believe I must do something drastic.

These GIFs are now biohazards and a risk to human life.
