## What is the best Minecraft Server Software?

I have come across this question more than a couple times in my quest to have a perfect SMP.

The purists would say Vanilla or Fabric w/ JellySquid's Lithium, but I would take Spigot/Bukkit plugins over mods and Datapacks any day.

Paper & its forks open the door for more performance.

I'm going to do a detailed breakdown of performance, memory usage, and playability on each JAR using spark.

Check back later!
