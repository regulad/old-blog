When does a GIF go from being funny to being cringy? I believe that there are 3 categories of GIFs.

A safe distance away | Close to the event horizon | Inside the singularity
--- | --- | ---
This category is for gifs that are legitemately funny and may cause a chuckle. | These are the gifs that your parents & teachers use trying to be relatable. | Aunt Sally learned how to use GIFHY, and she like minions! Take cover!

Going further right the GIFs will become cringier and lose all their comedic value. Any message they may be attmpting to convey is completely lost. Lets go through them one by one, shall we?

Today lets cover the first category,

### A safe distance away

The first category. These GIFs are ones your close friends may send you. They are extremely common on [Discord](/discord) servers and are more for comedic value than conveying any message. Here are some from my own favorite ones.

Many of these GIFs are exclusive to Discord or Reddit, since both of these sites have inline GIF posting from large services like GIFHY or Tenor. They frequently reference the Impact font memes and things that any Discord or Reddit member can associate with, like Video Games. They flood #memes channels and can have no relation to one another. I rate most of these GIFs a `8/10`
