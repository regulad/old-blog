# Stuff I own

Here is a record of some shiz I own and what is inside of them.

## Computers

#### I didn't include specs on things like fans or RGB strips because they arent important to performance.

    * About:
      * I put together this computer using spare parts on a $150 budget. I had almost everything laying around, but the memory and case had to be purchased from my local Micro Center.
      * I plan to use this machine as a Minecraft server, or maybe Plex if I decide to fork up money for Plex Pass.
        * For Minecraft, I'll run the Multicraft daemon here and the Multicraft panel on a VPS. I'll also put it behind a BungeeCord proxy hosted on PebbleHost.
