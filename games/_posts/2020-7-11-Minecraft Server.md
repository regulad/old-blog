## About
This is my vanilla-ish server network. Not too many gameplay-altering plugins, but enough to have fun.

{% include elements/integrations/namemcserver.html server="smp.play.regulad.xyz" %}

## Connect
* Java: `smp.play.regulad.xyz`
* Bedrock: `play.regulad.xyz`

Bedrock players will encounter a GeyserConnect proxy. The server is located within the Geyser section. You can connect to your own server from here.

Java players can also utilize a VIAaaS instance hosted at `play.regulad.xyz`, with the webserver located at http://macos2.regulad.xyz:25543/

You'll need to add yourself to [my Discord server](/r/discord) to link your account and join.
