## About
This is my vanilla-ish server network. Not too many gameplay-altering plugins, but enough to have fun.

{% include elements/integrations/namemcserver.html server="play.regulad.xyz" %}

## Connect
* Java:
  * SMP: `smp.play.regulad.xyz` (or `play.regulad.xyz`)
  * CMP: `cmp.play.regulad.xyz`
* Bedrock: `play.regulad.xyz` (Port: `25575`)

You can also switch servers using `/server smp/cmp`

You'll need to add yourself to [my Discord server](/r/discord) to link your account and join.
