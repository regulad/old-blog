    <h1>Parker's Bee Webzone</h1>
    <p>Howdy reader! My name is Parker, and I happen to be a bee enthusiast. Welcome to my webzone!</p> 
      <p>Why? Dunno. Just happened to like bees.</p>
    <p>Lets get into the coolest arthropds on the planet! </p>
    <h3>Why are bees dying?</h3>
    <p>You've seen it in the news, and it's sad. Bees are dying at an alarming rate. The main reason is a phenomenon called <b>Colonony collapse disorder</b>, or <b>CCD</b>. It was first obserbed in early 2006. (The year I was born!)</p>
    <p>In 1990, the number of honey bee colonies was in the 2-3 millions. Now, its in the 1-2 millions.</p>
    <h3>What can you do?</h3>
    <p>Although many things reguarding the bee-pocalypse are out of our human control, you can do many things to support the research and protection of dying bees.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy products grown without pesticides. Colonies can die when the food that the workers feed to the larvae has pesticides.</li>
    <li>Bees don't want to eat you. They want to eat the nectar from flower. Give them something to eat!</li>
    </ul>
