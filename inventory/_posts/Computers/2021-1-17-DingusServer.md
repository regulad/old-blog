* I put together this computer using spare parts on a $150 budget. I had almost everything laying around, but the memory and case had to be purchased from my local Micro Center.
* Specs:
  * Corsair Carbide 200R
  * EVGA 550 B3
  * Ryzen 3 3200G
  * AMD Wraith Stealth
  * ROG Strix B450-F Gaming
  * 1x8GB DDR4-3000 G.Skill Aegis
* Storage:
  * An SSD I literally picked out of the garbage (128gb)
* Software:
  * Ubuntu 20.04
