* I put together this computer using spare parts on a $150 budget. I had almost everything laying around, but the memory and case had to be purchased from my local Micro Center.
* Specs:
  * Corsair Carbide 200R
  * EVGA 550 B3
  * Ryzen 5 2600
  * EVGA GeForce 1650 Super
  * AMD Wraith Stealth
  * ROG Strix B450-F Gaming
  * 2x8GB DDR4-3000 Corsair Memory
* Storage:
  * An SSD I literally picked out of the garbage (128gb)
* Software:
  * Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS
    * Docker 20.10.6
